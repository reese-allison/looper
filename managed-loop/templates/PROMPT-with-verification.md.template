@plan.md @activity.md

Read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

Open plan.md and choose the next task where passes is false.

Work on exactly ONE task.

After implementing, verify with Playwright:
1. Navigate to the local server
2. Take a screenshot: screenshots/task-N.png

After completing:
1. Update activity.md with what you did and screenshot filename
2. Set that task's passes to true in plan.md  
3. Commit your changes

When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
